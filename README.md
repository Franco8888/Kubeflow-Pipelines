# Kubeflow-Pipelines

A repository that showcases how to implement machine learning pipelines on Google cloud platform using Kubeflow. These examples uses the python function-based method of implementing Kubeflow Pipelines. 

Note: The jupyter notebook files explain in detail how to setup the KFP SDK environment and how to connect to the pipelines on Google Cloud Platform

Examples in this repo:

![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Arithmetic Operations`

This example illustrates the basic concepts of a Kubeflow pipeline in which the components of the pipeline implements arithmetic operations.

![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Iris dataset`

This example illustrates a much more advanced example using the Iris Dataset. In this example we take the Iris dataset solution and implements it into a Kubeflow Pipeline. The Iris Dataset: https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/ml/
